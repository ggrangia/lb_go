# lb-go
A simple load balancer for experimental purposes

# HOW TO USE IT
The best way to use this "super basic load balancer" is shown in the docker-compose file.
The main purpose for this repo, is to have a baseline loadbalancer to fiddle with, testing new algorithms and so on.
It is advised to create a configuration file (by default it looks for a file called lb_go in the /app folder).
